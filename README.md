# Neural Network in C++

A simple neural network implementation in C++. This project is a learning exercise to improve C++ skills and understand neural network basics.

## Features

- `Tensor` class for matrix operations
- `Linear` layer implementation
- Forward pass functionality

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone github.com/gladuz/nn-cpp.git
   ```

2. Compile:
   ```
   g++ -std=c++17 *.cpp -o neural_net
   ```

3. Run:
   ```
   ./neural_net
   ```

## Future Plans

- Implement additional layer types
- Add backpropagation
